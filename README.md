# DeepPac-Mastery
"DeepPac Mastery" represents a groundbreaking endeavor within the realm of artificial intelligence, employing Deep Convolutional Q-Learning to achieve unparalleled proficiency in the iconic Pac-Man game. Nestled within the framework of OpenAI Gymnasium environment, this project harnesses the versatile and standardized platform to train an AI model that adeptly maneuvers through the intricate maze, outsmarting adversaries and optimizing strategic decision-making.

Distinguishing itself with the integration of eligibility trace, "DeepPac Mastery" elevates the learning capabilities of the AI agent. This reinforcement learning technique allows the model to effectively capture and leverage long-term dependencies within the environment, facilitating a more nuanced and context-aware decision-making process.

 "DeepPac Mastery"  navigates the challenges presented by Pac-Man's maze within the OpenAI Gymnasium. Through this project, we aim to showcase the prowess of AI in mastering complex gaming environments while pushing the boundaries of what's achievable in reinforcement learning with OpenAI Gymnasium.
